This Task Manager is a simple and user-friendly web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users efficiently organize and manage their daily tasks. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete tasks when no longer needed. With a clean and intuitive interface, it offers a seamless task management experience.

The front-end design is crafted with CSS to provide an aesthetically pleasing and responsive layout. HTML is used to structure the content, while JavaScript handles the dynamic functionalities such as task interactions and state updates.
